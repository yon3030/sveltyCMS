# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository. It's people like you that make this project such a great one.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. This helps contributors and maintainers understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### Pull Requests

This section guides you on how to propose changes to the project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers to understand and accept your contribution faster.

- Before creating a Pull Request, ensure that there isn't already a PR for the same update. If there is, contribute to the existing one instead of creating a new one.
- Ensure your work is on a branch off of `main`, not `main` itself.
- Only one feature/fix per pull request.

## Coding Style

This section should guide contributors about the coding style to follow while creating a Pull Request.

## Submitting Changes

This section guides you through submitting a pull request.

We use GitHub flow, so all code changes happen via pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and also ensure that your changes meet the Coding Style.
3. Issue that pull request!
